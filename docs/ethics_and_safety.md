# Ethics & Safety

- All telemetry in this repo is **synthetic**.
- Provider/ASN/organization identifiers are **fake buckets**.
- Content placeholders are **benign**, “public services / community” informational text.
- This repo avoids operational guidance for wrongdoing and focuses on defensive investigation methods.

If you adapt these workflows to real data:
- follow legal/compliance requirements
- minimize sensitive data exposure
- log access and maintain auditability
- redact identifiers before sharing artifacts
