# ATT&CK Notes — BodySnatcher (CVE-2025-12420)

## Why ATT&CK applies here
The reported behavior resembles a common enterprise intrusion arc:
- Initial access via exploitation/integration weakness
- Identity/impersonation to gain permissions
- Account creation + privilege assignment as a durable foothold

This is not “malware” centric; it’s **identity + workflow abuse**.

## Candidate technique mapping (summary)
- T1190 — Exploit Public-Facing Application  
  Rationale: exploitation of a platform interface / integration flaw to gain unauthorized action.

- T1078 — Valid Accounts (conditional / follow-on)  
  Rationale: if attacker creates/uses an account and then authenticates normally.

- T1136 — Create Account  
  Rationale: public report describes creating a new user record/account.

- T1098 — Account Manipulation  
  Rationale: role assignment / permissions modifications to elevate newly created or existing accounts.

- T1484 — Domain/Policy Modification (ONLY if you observe policy changes)  
  Rationale: include only when evidence shows policy or access control changes.

## Evidence-first rule
Only “lock in” techniques you can support with logs:
- user creation audit
- role assignment audit
- password reset/account recovery trails
- agent workflow execution logs
- configuration change logs for agent providers

## AI/agentic nuance to preserve (what makes this case special)
This case highlights that “agentic AI” can:
- bridge trust zones (external agent ↔ internal user identity)
- execute privileged tool actions
- produce misleading assurance if MFA/SSO is assumed but bypassed via integration logic

The core detection strategy is to correlate:
**agent sessions → privileged actions → identity changes**
