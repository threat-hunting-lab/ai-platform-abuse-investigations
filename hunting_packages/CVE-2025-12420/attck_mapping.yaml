case_id: CASE-OSINT-0001-CVE-2025-12420-servicenow-bodysnatcher
title: "BodySnatcher — ServiceNow Agentic AI Auth Weakness (OSINT)"
source: "AppOmni / AO Labs public report (Jan 13, 2026)"

techniques:
  - id: T1190
    name: Exploit Public-Facing Application
    confidence: medium
    rationale: >
      Public report describes an authentication weakness in platform-facing agentic AI components
      enabling impersonation/unauthorized action.
    data_sources:
      - ServiceNow API / access logs (if available)
      - ServiceNow audit logs (user/role/config changes)

  - id: T1136
    name: Create Account
    confidence: medium
    rationale: >
      Reported attack chain includes creation of a new user record/account.
    data_sources:
      - sys_user insert audit
      - user provisioning logs

  - id: T1098
    name: Account Manipulation
    confidence: medium
    rationale: >
      Reported chain includes modifying account privileges/roles (e.g., admin-like role assignment).
    data_sources:
      - sys_user_has_role insert audit
      - role / group membership change logs

  - id: T1078
    name: Valid Accounts
    confidence: low_to_medium
    rationale: >
      If attacker-created or attacker-controlled accounts are used to authenticate normally after creation/reset,
      this becomes relevant. Only assert if auth logs confirm it.
    data_sources:
      - authentication logs
      - session logs

detection_focus:
  - "agent session metadata correlated with identity/privilege changes"
  - "new user + privileged role within short window"
  - "password reset shortly after user creation"

notes:
  - "Mapping is OSINT-derived; confirm with local telemetry before final attribution."
